# The Morty Network

Spec Rick and Morty TV script lightly spoofing _The Social Network_ (2010) among other things.

## To Read

Click on `The Morty Network.pdf` above.

If you're new to reading/writing screenplays, [this](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-a-screenplay-formatting-tips-and-tricks) is a decent starting place.

## To Contribute

This script is written in the [Fountain](https://fountain.io/) format. VSCode has an [excellent extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piersdeseilligny.betterfountain) that makes it easy to write and compile `.fountain` files to `.pdf`. 

If you'd rather not use VSCode, most major screenwriting software supports importing and exporting into the `.fountain` format.

If you're new to Git and Github, I'd recommend downloading [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and using the [Source control tools](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview) built into the editor. You'll also need a Github account.

Using these tools, you can write scenes, new dialogue, etc. and [create a pull request](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github-using-vs-code-f03db28308c4) (a request to have your proposed changes incorporated into the original document). If I accept your proposal, you'll automatically be tracked as a co-author.

You can also simply comment on the script by clicking on a line in the `.fountain` file and [creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).

If any of this does not make sense, feel free to DM me.

## Why not just use FinalDraft, CeltX, WriterDuet? 

1) I'm addicted to [vim shortcuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR5bZriaOVU&ab_channel=Linode) which basically give you text editing superpowers.
2) I like using git/github for source control so I can comfortably delete and add stuff and still revert back to it later (without making a million separate versions of my scripts)
3) Fountain forces you to focus on story first, and formatting later.
4) I'm a huge hipster.
